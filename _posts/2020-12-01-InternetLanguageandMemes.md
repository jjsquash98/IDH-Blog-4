title: Internet Language:Memes
--- 
Growing up during the age of the internet and social media, I noticed that my choice of terms, phrases, and jokes constantly evolved along with the internet. The internet changes rapidly, as my current choices would not have fit into our same society as little as just ten years ago. As a millennial who is interested in both the digital humanities and satire, I began to wonder about the possible effects modern satire has on the sociolinguistic aspect of our society.  The Oxford English Dictionary defines sociolinguistics as “The study of language in relation to social factors”(OED), the main factor of which I will study is the digital. The prominence of satire in the digital world is consistently growing, whether that is through memes, youtube, TV shows, movies, or music.  According to Statista, a German company specializing in market and consumer data, “Almost 4.66 billion people were active internet users as of October 2020, encompassing 59 percent of the global population” (Statista). With so many active users, it is almost impossible to avoid some societal shifts that change parts of our social speaking culture.

One of the biggest shifts in satire that affects everyday language was the creation of the internet ‘meme culture.’ Memes are essentially humorous images or videos that become viral enough to the extent that they are referenced in everyday conversations, AKA internet language. According to Post Memes: Seizing the Memes of Production, by Alfie Brown and Dan Bristown, “...teenagers are using humor and irony---through the form of memes---to find ways to face up to and discuss deeper stresses and anxieties, too” (100). Issues tackled by memes include politics, racism, homophobia, and many others, but it is the satirical humor in these memes that gains peoples’ attention. Memes often use the same images or clips while changing the worded lines, so that they can fit different topics or issues, but this isn’t their only influential aspect.

The infamous Doge Meme became well known not only for the funny image, but also because of its use of two-word phrases. People became obsessed with this meme and often started talking in the same two-word-phrase style. This meme was also recreated over and over, but with different contexts. Politicians, musicians, influencers, business, and pretty much everyone else on the planet started creating, sharing, and enjoying memes.

	The popularity of meme culture has only increased over the years, and has changed many things sociolinguistically. It has become common practice to mention memes, talk in the style of memes, and to use memes to spread awareness for a serious cause, but as they evolve, so will we. But what does the future hold for meme culture and how can we study that? Beyond bringing us humor, I think scholars should work on understanding the impact of the evolution of memes throughout time. Imagine a database full of varying collections of memes and the recreation of those memes. These collections could be time-stamped, analyzed for their significant components: language, demeanor, topic, relevance to the time period, etc. Once completed, they can be compared to the social constructs apparent during their time of the creation, hopefully addressing the following questions:
How were the memes used?
Did the culture influence the memes, or did the memes influence the culture?
What relevance did the meme have during the specific time period?

These are big questions that may not have just one answer, but if something so simple as an internet post has the ability to change the way we act, speak, post, and think, then we should be studying them.
